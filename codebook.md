# Getting and Cleaning Data - tidy_data.txt Codebook

### About
tidy_data.txt contains the average of mean and standard deviation measurements grouped by Subject and Activity.

### Variables
- Subject: identifies subject, integer

- Activity: label of which activity subject was doing at time of data capture
    - Possible values: LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS
